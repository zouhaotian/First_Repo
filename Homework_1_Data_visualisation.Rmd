  *This homework is due September 5th 6pm.*
  
  (This set of exercise is mostly taken from R for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.)

# Exercise 1

1.  What's gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?

    ```{r}
    library(ggplot2)
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
    ```
    
    Answer: 

    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")
    ```

2.  Which variables in `mpg` are categorical? Which variables are continuous? 
    (Hint: type `?mpg` to read the documentation for the dataset). How
    can you see this information when you run `mpg`?

    Answer: 

    ```{r}
    str(ggplot2::mpg)
    ```
    Variable names were displayed after $
    `manufacturer`, `model`, `trans`, `drv`, `fl`, `class` are categorical
    `displ`, `year`, `cyl`, `cty`, `hwy` are continuous

3.  Map a continuous variable to `color`, `size`, and `shape`. How do
    these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. continuous
    variables?
    
    Answer: 
    
     `Color` can be mapped to a continuous variable. `Color` can be mapped to a categorical variable.
    `Size` can be mapped to a continuous variable. `Size` can be mapped to a categorical variable, but not advised.
    `Shape` cannot be mapped to a continuous variable, but it can be mapped to a categorical variable.
    
    ```{r}
    ggplot(data=mpg)+
      geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy, color=year))
    ggplot(data=mpg)+
      geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy, size=year))
    # ggplot(data=mpg)+
    #  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy, shape=year))
    ```

4.  What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics? 

    Answer: 
    
    The same variable that mapping to multiple aesthetics will make the graph too messy, and it also contains repeating information with multiple aesthetics. 
    
    ```{r}
    ggplot(data=mpg)+
      geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy, color=class, size=class, shape=class))
    ```

5.  What does the `stroke` aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with?
    (Hint: use `?geom_point`)
    
    Answer:
    
    The `stroke` aesthetic controls the size of the variable. It works with shape 21.
    
    ```{r}
    ```

6.  What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable 
    name, like `aes(colour = displ < 5)`?  

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```


# Exercise 2

1.  What do the empty cells in plot with `facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)` mean?
    How do they relate to this plot?
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = cyl))
    ```

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```

2.  What plots does the following code make? What does `.` do?

    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
      facet_grid(drv ~ .)
    
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
      facet_grid(. ~ cyl)
    ```

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```

3.  Take the first faceted plot in this section:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
      facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
    ```
    
    What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the colour aesthetic?
    What are the disadvantages? How might the balance change if you had a 
    larger dataset?
    
    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```

# Exercise 3

1.  What geom would you use to draw a line chart? A boxplot? 
    A histogram? An area chart?

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```

2.  Run this code in your head and predict what the output will look like.
    Then, run the code in R and check your predictions.
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
      geom_point() + 
      geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
    ```

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```

3.  What does `show.legend = FALSE` do?  What happens if you remove it?  
    Why do you think I used it earlier in the chapter?

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```

4.  What does the `se` argument to `geom_smooth()` do?


    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```

5.  Will these two graphs look different? Why/why not?

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
      geom_point() + 
      geom_smooth()
    
    ggplot() + 
      geom_point(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
      geom_smooth(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
    ```

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```

6.  Recreate the R code necessary to generate the following graphs.
    
    ![Smooth lines for each `drv`](`r "https://github.com/datasci611/datasci_src/blob/master/HW1P0306A.png?raw=true"`)
    
    
    Answer: 
    
    ```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

    ```


    ![A single smooth line, transparency by `year`](`r "https://github.com/datasci611/datasci_src/blob/master/HW1P0306B.png?raw=true"`)
    
    Answer: 
    
    ```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

    ```

    
    ![Layered dots and an additional text information](`r "https://github.com/datasci611/datasci_src/blob/master/HW1P0306C.png?raw=true"`)
    
    Adding texts was not covered in class, but give it a try!
    
    Answer: 
    
    ```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

    ```

# Exercise 4

1.  What is the default geom associated with `stat_summary()`? How could
    you rewrite the previous plot to use that geom function instead of the 
    stat function?

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```

2.  What does `geom_col()` do? How is it different to `geom_bar()`?

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```

3.  What variables does `stat_smooth()` compute? What parameters control
    its behaviour?

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```

# Exercise 5

1.  What is the problem with this plot? How could you improve it?

    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
      geom_point()
    ```

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```

2.  What parameters to `geom_jitter()` control the amount of jittering?

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```

3.  Compare and contrast `geom_jitter()` with `geom_count()`.

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```

# Exercise 6

1.  Turn a stacked bar chart into a pie chart using `coord_polar()`.

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```

2.  What does `labs()` do? Read the documentation.

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```

3.  What does the plot below tell you about the relationship between city
    and highway mpg? Why is `coord_fixed()` important? What does 
    `geom_abline()` do?
    
    ```{r, fig.asp = 1, out.width = "50%"}
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
      geom_point() + 
      geom_abline() +
      coord_fixed()
    ```

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```
