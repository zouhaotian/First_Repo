  *This homework is due September 5th 6pm.*
  
  (This set of exercise is mostly taken from R for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.)

# Exercise 1

1.  What's gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?

    ```{r}
    library(ggplot2)
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
    ```
    
    Answer: 

    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")
    ```

2.  Which variables in `mpg` are categorical? Which variables are continuous? 
    (Hint: type `?mpg` to read the documentation for the dataset). How
    can you see this information when you run `mpg`?

    Answer: 

    ```{r}
    str(ggplot2::mpg)
    ```
    
    `manufacturer`, `model`, `trans`, `drv`, `fl`, `class` are categorical
    
    `displ`, `year`, `cyl`, `cty`, `hwy` are continuous

3.  Map a continuous variable to `color`, `size`, and `shape`. How do
    these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. continuous
    variables?
    
    Answer: 
    
     `Color` can be mapped to a continuous variable. `Color` can be mapped to a categorical variable.
     
    `Size` can be mapped to a continuous variable. `Size` can be mapped to a categorical variable, but not advised.
    
    `Shape` cannot be mapped to a continuous variable, but it can be mapped to a categorical variable.
    
    ```{r}
    ggplot(data=mpg)+
      geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy, color=year))
    ggplot(data=mpg)+
      geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy, size=year))
    # ggplot(data=mpg)+
    #  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy, shape=year))
    ```

4.  What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics? 

    Answer: 
    
    The same variable that mapping to multiple aesthetics will make the graph too messy, and it also contains repeating information with multiple aesthetics. 
    
    ```{r}
    ggplot(data=mpg)+
      geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy, color=class, size=class, shape=class))
    ```

5.  What does the `stroke` aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with?
    (Hint: use `?geom_point`)
    
    Answer:
    
    The `stroke` aesthetic controls the width of the border. It works with shape 21.
    
    ```{r}
    ```

6.  What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable 
    name, like `aes(colour = displ < 5)`?  

    Answer:
    
    It will classify the `displ` to two categories: less than 5, greater or equal to 5. And the plot makes those two categories to two distinct colors.

    ```{r}
    ggplot(data=mpg)+
      geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy, color=displ<5))
    ```


# Exercise 2

1.  What do the empty cells in plot with `facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)` mean?
    How do they relate to this plot?
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = cyl))
    ```

    Answer: 
    
    The empty cells show that there is no such car in that category. The above plot just shows the relationship between `drv` and `cyl`. If there is no point for one combination of `drv` and `cyl`, then there is empty plot for this combination of `drv` and `cyl`.

    ```{r}

    ```

2.  What plots does the following code make? What does `.` do?

    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
      facet_grid(drv ~ .)
    
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
      facet_grid(. ~ cyl)
    ```

    Answer: 
    
    The `.` controls the direction of figures. If written after variable, then plots are arranged vertically. If written before, then plots are arranged horizontally.

    ```{r}

    ```

3.  Take the first faceted plot in this section:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
      facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
    ```
    
    What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the colour aesthetic?
    What are the disadvantages? How might the balance change if you had a 
    larger dataset?
    
    Answer: 
    
    The advantages are that the facet clearly classifies `class`, and draw distinct plots for different `class` variable instead of drawing all points in same plot.
    
    The disadvantages are that the plots for each category are too small, and points are crowded together.
    
    If the variables have too many categories, the color aesthetic would be appropriate. If not, the facet would be appropriate.
    
    ```{r}

    ```

# Exercise 3

1.  What geom would you use to draw a line chart? A boxplot? 
    A histogram? An area chart?

    Answer: 
    
    `Geom_line` is used to draw a line chart. `Geom_boxplot` is used to draw a boxplot. `Geom_histogram` is used to draw a histogram. `Geom_area` is used to draw an area chart.

    ```{r}

    ```

2.  Run this code in your head and predict what the output will look like.
    Then, run the code in R and check your predictions.
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
      geom_point() + 
      geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
    ```

    Answer: 
    
    I think the code is going to provide a plot with points between `displ` and `hwy`, with different categories of `drv`. And smoothed lines between `displ` and `hwy` is shown on the plot, categorized by `drv`, but without shaded area.

    ```{r}

    ```

3.  What does `show.legend = FALSE` do?  What happens if you remove it?  
    Why do you think I used it earlier in the chapter?

    Answer: 
    
    The `show.legend = FALSE` will suppress the legend of the variable. If removed, the legend is shown on the right of the plot. This is because the `drv` has few categories.

    ```{r}

    ```

4.  What does the `se` argument to `geom_smooth()` do?


    Answer: 
    
    The `se` argument will show or suppress the shaded area of the line.

    ```{r}

    ```

5.  Will these two graphs look different? Why/why not?

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
      geom_point() + 
      geom_smooth()
    
    ggplot() + 
      geom_point(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
      geom_smooth(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
    ```

    Answer: 
    
    The two graphs will look same. 
    
    For first plot, it uses `mpg` dataset, and maps `displ` and `hwy`. `geom_point()` draws all points between `displ` and `hwy`. `geom_smooth()` draws a smoothed line between `displ` and `hwy`.
    
    For second plot, `geom_point` uses `mpg` dataset, and draws all points between `displ` and `hwy`. `geom_smooth` uses `mpg` dataset, and draws a smoothed line between `displ` and `hwy`.

    ```{r}

    ```

6.  Recreate the R code necessary to generate the following graphs.
    
    ![Smooth lines for each `drv`](`r "https://github.com/datasci611/datasci_src/blob/master/HW1P0306A.png?raw=true"`)
    
    
    Answer: 
    
    ```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(color = drv)) + 
      geom_smooth(mapping = aes(linetype = drv), se = FALSE)
    ```


    ![A single smooth line, transparency by `year`](`r "https://github.com/datasci611/datasci_src/blob/master/HW1P0306B.png?raw=true"`)
    
    Answer: 
    
    ```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(color = drv, alpha = year)) + 
      geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
    ```

    
    ![Layered dots and an additional text information](`r "https://github.com/datasci611/datasci_src/blob/master/HW1P0306C.png?raw=true"`)
    
    Adding texts was not covered in class, but give it a try!
    
    Answer: 
    
    ```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(fill = drv), color = "White", shape = 21, size = 2,  stroke = 1) + annotate("text", x = 3, y = 44, label = "Max hwy = 44")
    ```

# Exercise 4

1.  What is the default geom associated with `stat_summary()`? How could
    you rewrite the previous plot to use that geom function instead of the 
    stat function?

    Answer: 
    
    The default geom is `summary`.

    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth)) + 
      geom_line() + 
      geom_point(stat = "summary", fun.y = median)
    ```

2.  What does `geom_col()` do? How is it different to `geom_bar()`?

    Answer: 
    
    `geom_col()` uses the height of bars to show the actual value of data. `geom_bar()` uses height to represent the count in each group.
    
    ```{r}
    
    ```

3.  What variables does `stat_smooth()` compute? What parameters control
    its behaviour?

    Answer:
    
    `stat_smooth` smooth the density of continuous variables. `method`, `formula`, `se`, `fullrange`, `level` control its behavior.
    

    ```{r}

    ```

# Exercise 5

1.  What is the problem with this plot? How could you improve it?

    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
      geom_point()
    ```

    Answer: 
    
    Many points are overlapping.

    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
      geom_point(position = 'jitter')
    ```

2.  What parameters to `geom_jitter()` control the amount of jittering?

    Answer: 
    
    `width` and `height` controls the amount of jittering.

    ```{r}

    ```

3.  Compare and contrast `geom_jitter()` with `geom_count()`.

    Answer: 
    
    Similar: Two functions both draw and display all points between two variables.
    Difference: `geom_jitter()` displays all points with same size. `geom_count()` displays points with distinct sizes, which is number of cases around each point.

    ```{r}

    ```

# Exercise 6

1.  Turn a stacked bar chart into a pie chart using `coord_polar()`.

    Answer: 

    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
      geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity)) + 
      coord_polar()
    ```

2.  What does `labs()` do? Read the documentation.

    Answer: 
    
    `labs()` uses new labels to display variables.

    ```{r}

    ```

3.  What does the plot below tell you about the relationship between city
    and highway mpg? Why is `coord_fixed()` important? What does 
    `geom_abline()` do?
    
    ```{r, fig.asp = 1, out.width = "50%"}
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
      geom_point() + 
      geom_abline() +
      coord_fixed()
    ```

    Answer:
    
    There is positive relationship between `cty` and `hwy`. When `cty` is higher, `hwy` tends to be higher.
    
    `coord_fixed()` will fix the ratio between units on the x axis and y axis. Otherwise, the plot will look like a flat.
    
    `geom_abline()` will add predicted line to the plot.

    ```{r}

    ```
